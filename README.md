# Awesome Portfolio Website

 An open-source project which provides a free full-fledged portfolio website. I worked on the front End of the project using HTML5, CSS3, JS(Vanilla),jQuery and
Bootstrap. Additionally, I leveraged Adobe Photoshop and Canva to enhance the interactivity of my website portfolio.
